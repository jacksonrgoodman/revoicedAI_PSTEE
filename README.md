# RevoicedAI PST:EE

My mod for adding AI Voiceover and dialog to the 2017 Beamdog port of Black Isle's iconic CRPG froom 1999, Planescape Torment: Enhanced Edition

As a disabled person this helps me continue to enjoy one of my favorite video games from my youth. I hope to share this with others who would like to experience the game in such a way. 

I am not interested in having a discussion about the use of AI with strangers on the internet, and especially with anyone who does not represent anyone who worked on this game.

## Instructions
1. Acquire Planescape Torment: Enhanced Edition
2. Install the software NearInfinity
3. Use NearInfinity to extract all of the `.dlg` files as WeIDU `.d` dialog files from `\chitin.key\DLG`
4. place in root of this project in folder called `"dialog-extract"`
5. configure env variables
6. set up venv and install requirements
6. run main.py
